# NeurorehabilitationOfWristUsingManipulandum

This single degree of freedom manipulandum simulates the human movement by providing
either  force  or  impedance  at  the  end  points.  Further,  with  the  implementation  of  machine
learning, the evaluation parameters of the subjects are well off compared to that of the available
data of healthy individuals for proper assessment and a competency level is determined for
therapeutic exercises. The level of the exercises is varied by changing the resistive torque,
frequency and the range of motion. The motor will provide assistance or resistance based on the
competency of the subject. The modelling of the manipulandum is carried out in solidworks,
finite element static analysis is done in Ansys, simulation is carried out in Matlab for PID controller
tuning and this simulated value is used for position feedback control using PID to control position
and torque control for therapeutic exercises. 
 
The results obtained are compared with that of the outcome from the test subjects, the measuring
metrics being the grip strength, range of motion and precision. The grip strength was increased
from 24.3N to 28.6N, increasing the range of motion by 8.5% for flexion and extension of a
wrist with a precision of 88.3%. The future work of the project aims to implement a multi
Degree of Freedom manipulandum not only specific to wrist for flexion and extension but also
for other two degrees of freedom and an extension to the forearm as well.
